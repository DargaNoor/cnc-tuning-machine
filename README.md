I have worked as an Intern for the topic named Digital Twin For CNC Tuning (Cyber Physical System).
All were divided as teams by the mentor and allocated work every weekened.
During this internship,we(as a team of 3 members) prepared a machine learning model using sklearn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas  which can simulate working of reading datasets under any given condition.We were mainly working on to predict the surface roughness of the cnc tuning machine.We mainly focused on the machin learning model that gives the best accuracy.From the data we observed/given, we increased our samples by using under/over sampling methods.With the help of these conditions we came up with a machine learning models called logistic regression,linearSVC and confusion matrix to find out the accuracy.
With the help and support of our mentors, we were able to complete the allocated work on time, mainly working on regression models and preparing a model which could predict the accuracy of the model based on the train and testing datasets.
